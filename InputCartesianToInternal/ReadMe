This folder contains one input (lysozym protein), for Cartesian to internal coordinates conversian. 
The input set can be use both for C (CPU) and CUDA (GPU) versions. 
The input sets are already pre-processed with VMD and ready to use in the programs.

- Lysozym: one example of input for Cartesian coordinates to internal, from Lysozym protein,
  
  This input has has a total of 17,566 atoms (includingwater) and includes 2,210  time frame. this has been extracted from PSF and .dcd files
  that shows the Cartesian coordinates for different time frames.
  
  The folder consisted of 
  bond : This files shows the list of atoms that have make bond together.
  theta: This files shows the list of atoms that have make an angle together.
  propers: This files shows the list of atoms that have make proper dihedral together.
  impropers: This files shows the list of atoms that have make improper dihedral together.
