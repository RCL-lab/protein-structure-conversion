VMD-CartesianCoordinateOutput : 
	This folder contains the Cartesian coordinate of two different protein.
	These are the output of preprocessing step, VMD-Preprocessing/Extract-Cartesian-Backbone&SideChain.tcl
	The content of this folder is used to validate the accuracy of our Internal to Cartesian program output.
